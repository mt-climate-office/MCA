It is our goal to provide science-based information that serves as a resource for residents of Montana who are interested in understanding Montana’s climate and its impacts on water, agricultural lands and forests. To provide this understanding, we can learn from past climate trends. However, knowledge of the past is only partially sufficient in preparing for a future defined by unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Therefore, we also provide projections of change into the future using today’s best scientific information and modeling techniques."

    "text": "Key Messages\nAnnual average temperatures, including daily minimums, maximums, and averages, have risen across the state between 1950 and 2015. The increases range between 2.0-3.0°F (1.1-1.7°C) during this period.\nWinter and spring in Montana have experienced the most warming. Average temperatures during these seasons have risen by 3.9°F (2.2°C) between 1950 and 2015.\nMontana’s growing season length is increasing due to the earlier onset of spring and more extended summers; we are also experiencing more warm days and fewer cool nights. From 1951-2010, the growing season increased by 12 days. In addition, the annual number of warm days has increased by 2.0% and the annual number of cool nights has decreased by 4.6% over this period.\nDespite no historical changes in average annual precipitation between 1950 and 2015, there have been changes in average seasonal precipitation over the same period. Average winter precipitation has decreased by 0.9 inches (2.3 cm), which can mostly be attributed to natural variability and an increase in El Niño events, especially in the western and central parts of the state. A significant increase in spring precipitation (1.3-2.0 inches [3.3-5.1 cm]) has also occurred during this period for the eastern portion of the state.\nThe state of Montana is projected to continue to warm in all geographic locations, seasons, and under all emission scenarios throughout the 21st century. By mid century, Montana temperatures are projected to increase by approximately 4.5-6.0°F (2.5-3.3°C) depending on the emission scenario. By the end-of-century, Montana temperatures are projected to increase 5.6-9.8°F (3.1-5.4°C) depending on the emission scenario. These state-level changes are larger than the average changes projected globally and nationally.\nThe number of days in a year when daily temperature exceeds 90°F (32°C) and the number of frost-free days are expected to increase across the state and in both emission scenarios studied. Increases in the number of days above 90°F (32°C) are expected to be greatest in the eastern part of the state. Increases in the number of frost-free days are expected to be greatest in the western part of the state.\nAcross the state, precipitation is projected to increase in winter, spring, and fall; precipitation is projected to decrease in summer. The largest increases are expected to occur during spring in the southern part of the state. The largest decreases are expected to occur during summer in the central and southern parts of the state."

    "text": "Climate is driven largely by radiation from the sun. Incoming solar radiation may be reflected, absorbed by land surface and water bodies, transformed (as in photosynthesis), or emitted from the land surface as longwave radiation. Each of these processes influences climate through changes to temperature, winds, the water cycle, and more. The overall process is best understood by considering the Earth’s energy budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Earth’s Energy Budget\n\n\n\nThe Earth’s climate is driven by the sun. The balance between incoming and outgoing radiation—Earth’s radiation or energy budget—determines the energy available for changes in temperature, precipitation, and winds and, hence, influences atmospheric chemistry and the hydrologic cycle. The Earth’s surface, atmosphere, and clouds absorb a portion of incoming solar radiation, thereby increasing temperatures. Energy as longwave radiation (heat) is re-emitted to the atmosphere, clouds, or space, thereby reducing temperatures at the source. If the absorbed solar radiation and emitted heat are in balance, the Earth’s temperature remains constant.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The Earth’s radiation balance is the main driver of our climate. Image courtesy of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (1)\n\n\n\n\nNatural factors contributing to past climate change are well documented and include changes in atmospheric chemistry, ocean circulation patterns, solar radiation intensity, snow and ice cover, Earth’s orbital cycle around the sun, continental position, and volcanic eruptions. While these natural factors are linked to past climate change, they are also incorporated in the analysis of current climate change.\nSince the Industrial Revolution, global climate has changed faster than at any other time in Earth’s history (Mann et al. 1999). This rapid rate of change—often referred to as human-caused climate change—has resulted from changes in atmospheric chemistry, specifically increases in greenhouse gases due to increased combustion of fossil fuels, land-use change (e.g., deforestation), and fertilizer production (Figure 2-1) (Forster et al. 2007). The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), water vapor (H2O), and ozone (O3).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Changes in important global atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations from year 0 to 2005 AD (ppm, ppb = parts per million and parts per billion, respectively) (Forster et al. 2007).\n\n\nIncoming solar radiation is either absorbed, reflected, or re-radiated from the Earth’s surface. Since greenhouse gas concentrations are greatest near the surface, a large fraction of this reflected and re-radiated energy is absorbed in the lower portions of the atmosphere (hence the increase in surface temperatures and the term “greenhouse effect”—see sidebar). For the total energy budget to balance, the energy (and temperature) at the top of the atmosphere must decrease to account for the increase of energy (and temperature) near the Earth’s surface.\nAt natural levels, greenhouse gases are crucial for life on Earth; they help keep average global temperatures above freezing and at levels that sustain plant and animal life. However, at the increased levels seen since the Industrial Revolution (roughly 275 ppm then, 400 ppm now; Figure 1.2), greenhouse gases are contributing to the rapid rise of our global average temperatures by trapping more heat, often referred to as human-caused climate change. In the following chapters, we will refer to the impacts and effects of climate change as a result of both natural variability and human-caused climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greenhouse Effect\n\n\n\nThe Earth’s climate is driven by the sun. The high temperature of the sun results in the emission of high energy, shortwave radiation. About 31% of the shortwave radiation from the sun is reflected back to space by clouds, air molecules, dust, and lighter colored surfaces on the earth. Another 20% of the shortwave radiation is absorbed by ozone in the upper atmosphere and by clouds and water vapor in the lower atmosphere. The remaining 49% is transmitted through the atmosphere to the land surfaces and oceans and is absorbed. The Earth’s surface re-emits about 79% of the absorbed energy as longwave radiation. Unlike shortwave radiation, the Earth’s atmosphere absorbs approximately 90% of the longwave radiation emitted from objects on its surface. This results because of the presence of gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and various industrial products (e.g. chlorofluorocarbons; CFCs) that more effectively absorb longwave radiation. In turn, the energy absorbed by these gases is reradiated in all directions. The portion that is redirected back towards the surface contributes to warming and a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Climate change occurs when the Earth’s energy budget is not in balance. Such change generally takes place over centuries and millennia. Human-caused climate change has been occurring over the last 200 yr, largely because of the combustion of fossil fuels and subsequent increase of atmospheric CO2. Carbon dioxide, as well as CH4 and other gases, absorb and re-emit longwave radiation back to the earth’s surface that would otherwise radiate rapidly into outer space, thus warming the Earth. This increase in incoming longwave radiation is the greenhouse effect. Image courtesy the National Academies of Sciences (NAS undated).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Atkinson, J. What is earth’s energy budget?

    "section": "",
    "text": "A growing awareness of our changing global climate since the 1950s has led to a substantial body of research. For example, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS 2011) report, American’s Climate Choices, stated:\n\nClimate change is occurring, is very likely caused primarily by human activities, and poses significant risks to humans and the environment. These risks indicate a pressing need for substantial action to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare for adapting to its impacts.\n\nIn 1990, the United Nations tasked the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, see sidebar) with assessing existing research on climate change. Since then, five IPCC assessments have increased our scientific understanding of, and certainty about, global climate change. As described later in this chapter, the assessments have incorporated increasingly sophisticated models and analyses that consider both natural and human contributions to changes in our climate system.\nIn its most recent Fifth Assessment Report, the IPCC raised the likelihood of changes in several global climate events to “virtually certain” (i.e., 99-100% likelihood). Examples of these events include: more frequent hot days, less frequent cold days, reductions in permafrost, and sea-level rise (IPCC 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the IPCC\n\n\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization, and subsequently endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly. The goal of the IPCC is to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The IPCC\n\n\n\n\nRecently, the third National Climate Assessment, produced in collaboration with the US Global Change Research Program, provided further insight into the anticipated climate changes for the conterminous US. The National Climate Assessment (NCA 2014) states:\n\nEvidence for changes in Earth’s climate can be found from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. Researchers from around the world have compiled this evidence using satellites, weather balloons, thermometers at surface stations, and many other types of observing systems that monitor the Earth’s weather and climate. The sum total of this evidence tells an unambiguous story: the planet is warming."

    "text": "3.1 Climate Conditions 1981 - 2020\nTo assess Montana’s current climate, we analyzed climate variable data (see sidebar) provided as 3-decade of gridMET climate data1. In this section, we review average temperature and precipitation conditions from 1981-2010 as an indicator of current climate conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Variables\n\n\n\nIn analyses of climate, scientists employ a suite of 50 essential climate variables to unify discussions (Global Climate Observing System undated). For this assessment, we primarily focus on just two: how climate change will affect Montana’s temperature and precipitation in the future.\n\nTemperature is an objective measure of how hot or cold and object is with reference to some standard value. Temperature differences across the Earth result primarily from regional differences in absorbed solar radiation. Seasonal variations in temperature result from the tilt of the Earth’s axis as it rotates around the sun.\nPrecipitation is the quantity of water (solid or liquid) falling to the Earth’s surface at a specific place during a given period. Like temperature, precipitation varies seasonally and from place to place. Precipitation amounts can have a dramatic impact on local environmental conditions, such as abundance of wildlife or potential for crop production.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Temperature\nTable 3.1 shows the average seasonal temperature variation across Montana’s 7 Climate Divisions from 1981-2010.

    "text": "3.2 Historical Trends 1979 - Present\nWe evaluated how temperature and precipitation have historically changed, dating back to 1950. This review of historical trends helps us provide context for future climate change scenarios explored in later sections of this chapter. In addition, evaluating these trends can help us better understand a) how Montana has previously experienced and responded to changing climate, b) if projections of future change reveal a different climate than we have previously experienced, and c) the potential impacts of that projected change.\nThe presentation of trends that follows is confined to the period from 1950–2015 using data from NOAA’s NClimGrid Dataset (2). This is widely acknowledged as the benchmark period in climate analysis (3), a period when our network of meteorological sensors becomes more accurate and sufficiently dense.\n\n3.2.1 Temperature\nTable 3.3 shows the decadal rate of change from 1950-2015 for average annual temperatures across Montana 7 Climate Divisions. We provide that rate of change both annually and by season for Montana. We also present the average annual and average seasonal changes across the region.

Between 1950 and 2015, Montana’s average annual precipitation has not changed by 0 inches.\n\n\n3.2.3 Extreme aspects of Montana’s climate\nAlong with analyzing historical trends in temperature and precipitation, we performed an analysis of changes in extreme climate events since the middle of last century. Two examples of climate extremes include periods of intense warm or cool temperatures and significant wet or dry spells across seasons. Because these events affect every aspect of our society, decision makers and stakeholders are increasingly in need of historical evaluations of extreme events and how they are changing from seasons to centuries. The coldest temperature ever observed in the conterminous US was -70°F (-57°C) at Rogers Pass outside of Helena on January 20, 1954 (see sidebar). Since 1950, however, our analysis shows the average winter temperature has increased by 0.4°F/decade (0.2°C/decade) across the state, with an overall average winter temperature increase of 3.6°F (2.0°C). Average spring temperatures have increased by 2.6°F (1.4°C) during the same period, and average summer temperatures have risen by 2.0°F (1.1°C). Montana’s fall average temperatures have increased by 1.6°F (0.9°C) since 1950.\nWe performed our analysis of climate extremes using the CLIMDEX project (CLIMDEX undated), which provides a collection of global and regional climate data from multiple sources. CLIMDEX is developed and maintained by researchers at the Climate Change Research Centre and the University of New South Wales, in collaboration with the University of Melbourne, Climate Research Division of Environment Canada, and NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. The CLIMDEX project aims to produce a global dataset of standardized indices representing the extreme aspects of climate. Particular attention was placed on the changes in variables such as consecutive dry days, days of heavy precipitation, growing season length, frost days, number of cool days and nights, and the number of warm days and nights. Extreme precipitation events across the United States have increased in both intensity and frequency since 1901 (NCA 2014), including across both the High Plains and the northwestern US (many states combined), where studies have shown an increase in the number of days with extreme precipitation (NCA 2014). However, for our analysis at the state level we found no evidence of changes in extreme precipitation so it is not a variable of focus. Here, we report those variables that did change significantly (p<0.05) for Montana and, for perspective, the climate normals for these extremes for the periods 1951–1980 and from 1981-2010 (Table 2-5).\nextremes table\nThe annual number of cool days and the number of days with frost are decreasing across Montana. We use the CLIMDEX definition of cool days as the percentage of days when maximum temperature is lower than 10% of the historical observations. Coincident with warming temperatures, the number of cool days each year during the period from 1951–2010 has decreased by 13.3 days. Along with this trend, the number of days in which the minimum temperatures are below 32°F (0°C; i.e. frost days) has decreased by 12 days during this time period. These trends have contributed to an overall increase in the growing season length of 12 days between 1951 and 2010. In addition, the number of warm days, where maximum temperature exceeds 90°F (32°C) based on historical conditions, has increased by 11 days over this period. At a sub-annual level, monthly maximum and minimum temperatures have also changed. These are defined as the monthly maximum (minimum) value of daily maximum (minimum) temperatures. Monthly minimum values of daily minimum temperatures have increased by 5°F (2.8°C) from the period 1951–2010. Over the same time period, monthly minimum values of daily maximum temperatures have increased by 1.1°F (0.6°C).\nThere has been an increase in the number of warm nights and a related decrease in the number of cool nights across Montana. We use the CLIMDEX definition of warm nights (and cool nights) as the number of days when minimum temperature is higher (lower) than a specified maximum (minimum) threshold defined by historical conditions. The number of warm nights has increased by 11 days from 1951 to 2010. The number of cool nights has decreased by 12 days over this same period. These trends are in agreement with observations across many portions of the continental US (Davy and Esau 2016).\n\nBetween 1951 and 2010, the growing season in Montana increased 12 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrought\n\n\n\nDrought is a recurrent climate event that may vary in intensity and persistence by region. Drought can have broad and potentially devastating environmental and economic impacts (Wilhite 2000); thus, it is a topic of ongoing, statewide concern.\nThrough time, Montana’s people, agriculture, and industry, like its ecosystems, have evolved with drought. Today, many entities across the state address drought, including private and non-profit organizations, state and federal agencies, and landowners, as well as unique watershed partnerships.\nDrought is a complex phenomenon driven by both climate, but also affected by human-related factors (e.g., land use, water use). Although the definition of drought varies in different operational contexts, most definitions include several interrelated components, including:\n\nmeteorological drought, defined as a deficit in precipitation and above average evapotranspiration that lead to increased aridity;\nhydrological drought, characterized by reduced water levels in streams, lakes, and aquifers following prolonged periods of meteorological drought;\necological drought, defined as a prolonged period over which an ecosystem’s demand for water exceeds the supply (the resulting water deficit, or shortage, creates multiple stresses within and across ecosystems); and\nagricultural drought, commonly understood as a deficit in soil moisture and water supply that lead to decreased productivity (in this assessment, we will treat this form of drought as an important component of ecological drought).\n\nWhile the subsequent chapters dealing with water, agriculture, and forests treat the subject of drought differently, each describes drought within the context of one or more of the four definitions described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

That line, then, provides a means of projecting future conditions. Whether or not those projections are valid is a separate question. For example, the model may be based on false assumptions: the relationship may a) not be constant through time, b) not include outside influences such as human interventions (e.g., policy regulations), and c) not consider system feedbacks that might enhance or dampen the relationship being modeled.\nWhile the linear regression model provides an instructive visual aid for considering modeling, it is too simple for looking at climate changes, in which the interactions are complex and often nonlinear. For example, if temperatures rises, evaporation is expected to increase. At the same time, increasing temperatures increase the atmosphere’s capacity to hold water. Water is a greenhouse gas so more water in the atmosphere means the atmosphere can absorb more heat… thus driving more evaporation. What seemed a simple relationship has changed (possibly dramatically) because of this feedback between temperature, evaporation, and the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere.\nLinear models do not account for such nonlinear relationships. Instead, climate scientists account for nonlinearity through computer simulations that describe the physical and chemical interactions between the land, oceans, and atmosphere. These simulations, which project climate change into the future, are called general circulation models (GCMs; see sidebar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Circulation Models\n\n\n\nGeneral circulation models (GCMs) help us project future climate conditions. They are the most advanced tools currently available for simulating the response of the global climate system—including processes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land surface—to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.\nGCMs depict the climate using a 3-D grid over the globe, typically having a horizontal resolution of between 250 and 600 km (160 and 370 miles), 10-20 vertical layers in the atmosphere and sometimes as many as 30 layers in the oceans. Their resolution is quite coarse. Thus, impacts at the scale of a region, for example for Montana, require downscaling the results from the global model to a finer spatial grid (discussed later) (text adapted from IPCC 2013b).\n\n\nBecause of the complexities involved, climate scientists rarely rely on a single model, but instead use an ensemble (or suite) of models. Each model in an ensemble represents a single description of future climate based on specific initial conditions and assumptions. The use of multiple models helps scientists explore the variability of future projections (i.e., how certain are we about the projection) and incorporate the strengths, as well as uncertainties, of multiple approaches.\nFor the work of the Montana Climate Assessment, we employed an ensemble from the sixth iteration of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), which includes over 100 GCMs depending on the experiment conducted (1). The World Climate Research Program describes CMIP as “a standard experimental protocol for studying the output” of GCMs (2). It provides a means of validating, comparing, documenting, and accessing diverse climate model results. The CMIP project dates back to 1995, with the sixth iteration (CMIP6) starting in 2016 and providing climate data for the latest IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (3).\nWe employed 8 individual GCMs from the CMIP6 project for the Montana Climate Assessment ensemble, chosen because they provide daily outputs and are found to have a realistic performance over North America (4)\nThe benefits of using CMIP6 data are that each model in the ensemble a) has been rigorously evaluated, and b) uses the same standard socioeconomic trajectories—known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)—to describe future greenhouse gas emissions. “The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development” (5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShared Socioeconomic Pathways\n\n\n\nThere are five different SSP categories that climate projections are grouped by (following text taken from5): - SSP1 Sustainability: Taking the Green Road (Low challenges to mitigation and adaptation) The world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nSSP2 Middle of the Road: (Medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation) The world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\nSSP3 Regional Rivalry: A Rocky Road (High challenges to mitigation and adaptation) A resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\nSSP4 Inequality: A Road Divided (Low challenges to mitigation, high challenges to adaptation) Highly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\nSSP5 Fossil-fueled Development: Taking the Highway (High challenges to mitigation, low challenges to adaptation) This world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\n\n\nFor the Montana Climate Assessment, we explore the SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, and SSP5 scenarios.\nDue to their complexity and global extent, GCMs can be computationally intensive. Thus, scientists often make climate projections at coarse spatial resolution where each projected data point is an average value of a grid cell that measures hundreds of miles (kilometers) across.\nFor areas where the terrain and land cover are relatively homogenous (e.g., an expanse of the Great Plains), such coarse grid cells may be adequate to capture important climate processes. But in areas with complex landscapes like Montana, data points so widely spaced are inadequate to reflect variability in terrain and vegetation and their influence on climate. A 100 mile (161 km) grid, for example, might not capture the climate effects of a small mountain range rising out of the eastern Montana plains or the climate differences between mountain summits and valleys in western Montana where temperature and precipitation vary greatly.\nTo capture such important terrain characteristics, scientist take the coarse-resolution output from a GCM and statistically attribute the results from those models to smaller regions at higher resolution (e.g., grid points at 1 mile rather than 100 mile apart). This process, called downscaling, more accurately represents climate across smaller, more complex landscapes, including Montana.\nFor this climate assessment, we used a statistical downscaling method called the Multivariate Adaptive Constructive Analogs. By using a downscaled dataset—rather than the original output from the ensemble of GCMs—we gained the ability to evaluate temperature and precipitation at relatively high resolution statewide before conveying the results at the climate division scale. Additionally, we were able to aggregate data points within each of Montana’s seven climate divisions (Figure 2-3), and look at Montana’s climate future in different geographic areas. Aggregating to the climate-division level minimizes the potential for false precision by reporting results at spatial scales that better represent underlying climate processes.\nThe 8 downscaled GCMs in CMIP6 were evaluated at two future time periods: 1) mid century (2040–2069) and 2) end-of-century (2070–2099). Thirty-year averages of these future projections were then compared to a historical (1981–2010) 30-year average, which results in a projected difference, or change, from historical conditions. We make those projections using the stabilization the four SSPs outlined above. These future projections were then compared to the historical trends in Montana to reveal the major climate-associated changes that Montana is likely to experience in the future."

Those projections cover all SSP scenarios and two periods: mid century (2040-2069) and end-of-century (2070-2099).\nWe discuss a subset of our precipitation modeling results here, including a) precipitation projections reported by the mean values of the 8 GCM ensemble and b) figures that include maps and graphs that represent the mean and distribution of values observed for precipitation across the 8 GCMs. Special consideration is required for interpretations of precipitation changes in Montana’s complex terrain. Precipitation increases drastically with elevation such as that found in northwest Montana. Here, mean values do not characterize the potential for spatial variability that exists within these regions.\n\n4.4.1 Average Annual Precipitation\nFigure 4.9 and Figure 4.10 show projected changes in annual total precipitation for both the mid- and end-of-century.

    "text": "Additional climate variables.—Our analysis provides a critical local look at changes for two important climate variables, precipitation and temperature. However, Montana’s climate and its impacts go beyond these. A more in depth downscaling effort that involves physics based models will be required to evaluate two additional important variables, evapotranspiration and drought.\nLand use and land cover change.—Most climate analyses do not account for changes in land cover with climatic trends. However, interactions between climate, vegetation cover, and land use quality are tightly coupled. For example, with changes in temperature and precipitation, ecosystems within Montana may shift to drier conditions resulting in changes to vegetation types. This would contribute to a difference in evapotranspiration rates and aridity.\nPrecipitation timing and form.—We took a first look at changes in Montana’s precipitation. However, it is well known that the timing (winter versus spring and summer) and form (rain versus snow) of Montana’s precipitation is critical for areas such as water, forests, and agriculture resources. More work that incorporates physically based, distributed hydrological models is required to understand how our precipitation distribution will change in both space (low elevations to mountaintops) and time."

    "text": "The analysis presented in this chapter shows that Montana has warmed—up to 2.7°F (1.5°C) annually as averaged across the state—since 1950. Seasonally, that warming has been greatest in winter (3.9°F [2.2°C]) and spring (2.6°F [1.4°C]). Montana’s number of frost days has decreased by 12 days since 1951. Statewide, average annual precipitation did not change between 1950 and 2015, although variations caused by global climate oscillations, such as El Niño events, explain some of the historical precipitation variability in parts of the state.\nWith this historical context, we considered Montana’s future under two potential greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Using those scenarios, we employed standard modeling techniques available to climate scientists today—ensembles of general circulation models—and projected Montana’s climate over the next century. Our analyses focused on projecting the possible range of temperature and precipitation amounts in Montana, under our chosen greenhouse gas emission scenarios.\nWhile the model results varied, one message is imminently clear: Montana in the coming century will be a warmer place.\n\nOne thing is clear: Montana in the coming century will be a warmer place.\n\nIn Table 2-6 we provide a summary of the work done and described in this chapter (plus in accompanying appendices). In summary, Montana is projected to continue to warm in all geographic locations, seasons, and under all emission scenarios throughout the 21st century. By mid century, Montana temperatures are projected to increase by up to 6°F (3°C); by the end of the century, temperatures will increase by up to 9.8°F (5.4°C) (both projections depend on the particular carbon emission scenario [i.e., RCP], and these numbers are based on the business-as-usual [RCP8.5] scenario). Projections show that we could have up to 70 more frost-free days at the end of the century. Likewise, frequency of extreme heat will increase. In eastern Montana, for example, we may have as many as 54 days/yr in which maximum temperatures exceed 90°F (32°C).\nIn mid- and end-of-century projections, average annual precipitation and variability increase across the state, as do winter, spring, and fall precipitation. Summer months, however, show small decreases in precipitation. Current projections suggest little change in the frequency of dry and wet events, although projections in the former case show high uncertainty.\nMontanans must be prepared for projected increases in temperature in the future. Because of its interior location, Montana has warmed more over the last 65 yr than the national average, and it will experience greater warming than most parts of the country in the future, particularly when compared to states in coastal regions. Key to the concern is that coming temperature changes will be larger in magnitude and occur more rapidly than any time since our 1889 declaration of statehood (and, to be sure, well before).\n\nMontana’s average annual temperature is projected to increase through the end-of-century for all models, all emission scenarios, and in all geographic locations.\n\nSummary Table"
